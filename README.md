# Jumping Arrows Game

Jumping Arrows is a simple game where the objective is to move all the arrows pointing left to the left side and all the arrows pointing right to the right side. The game consists of six arrows, with three pointing left and three pointing right, initially arranged in alternating directions with an empty space in the middle. Arrows can only move in the direction they are pointing and can jump over one arrow to reach an empty space.

## Rules
- Click on "←" to move left or jump over one arrow to the left.
- Click on "→" to move right or jump over one arrow to the right.

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script.
2. Click on the arrows to move them left or right.
3. Continue moving arrows until all left-directed arrows are on the left and all right-directed arrows are on the right.

## Features
- Visual representation of the game using the tkinter library.
- Option to reset the game and start again.
